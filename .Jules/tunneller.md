## Generation Heuristics
- **Hue + Gap Variety = Mood**: Simply shifting the HSL hue and tightening the gap range creates distinct, readable "districts" without needing new assets.
- **Progression Scaling**: Increasing obstacle density (0.3 -> 0.7) and narrowing gaps (120px -> 50px) over the course of the level creates a natural difficulty curve.
