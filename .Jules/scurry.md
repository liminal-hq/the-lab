## Pizza Slice Collectible
- **Learning**: Placing high-value collectibles in dangerous areas (like gaps between buildings) creates a nice risk/reward dynamic. It forces players to deviate from the optimal "safe" path (jumping early) to a "risky" path (jumping late or falling then jumping). This adds depth without new mechanics.
