### Canvas Game Verification
*   **Pattern:** Validating Game Logic via Global State Injection.
*   **Context:** Canvas-based games often lack DOM elements for state.
*   **Solution:** Expose `window.gameState` (or similar) and use Playwright's `page.evaluate()` to manipulate state (e.g., spawn entities) and assertions.
*   **Sync:** Use `page.waitForFunction` to ensure game loop has processed the injected state before asserting.
