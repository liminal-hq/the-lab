> "If you're reading this, it's already too late. They're everywhere. Not just in the sewers. They're in the code.
> I've seen things... ASCII art where comments should be. Functions that squeak when you run them.
> The story isn't just in the game. It's hidden. Fragmented.
> You have to look closer. Check the source code. Check the logs. Check the dark corners of the repository.
> The truth is out there... and it wants cheese."
