[Verse 1]
Who has seen the biggest rat?
People wanna know
I saw 'em in the basement
A long time ago
Jimmy said he saw a rat
Bigger than his head
It fell down from the ceiling
It ran across the bed

[Verse 2]
They’re swarming in Barzini's
They've got nothing to eat
Like the gangs in West Side Story
They’re fighting in the street
Part of COVID landscape
Ambulances peal
Underneath it all
Hear the rodent population squeal

[Chorus]
Rats are on the warpath
Rats are on parade
Come and see them running through
The apocalypse man-made
Welcome to this urban life
Welcome to my city
Survival of the fittest
Is never very pretty

[Verse 3]
The rats came through the bottom
Of the Prius in the street
Attacked it with their yellow teeth
And ate up the back seat
Jimmy said he saw a rat
Bigger than his head
It fell down from the ceiling
It ran across the bed

[Chorus]
Rats are on the warpath
Rats are on parade
Come and see them running through
The apocalypse man-made
Welcome to this urban life
Welcome to my city
Survival of the fittest
Is never very pretty

[Bridge]
A terrifying sight
Feeling so much fright
Step over them in the evening
Hear them running through tunnels in the subway in the night
[Chorus]
Rats are on the warpath
Rats are on parade
Come and see them running through
The apocalypse man-made
Welcome to this urban life
Welcome to my city
Survival of the fittest
Is never very pretty

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Rats are on the warpath
Rats are on parade
Come and see them running through
The apocalypse man-made
Welcome to this urban life
Welcome to my city
Survival of the fittest
Is never very pretty

[Outro]
Oh no
Oh no
Rats, rats, rats
Oh no
Welcome to this urban life
