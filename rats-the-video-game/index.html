    RATS: THE VIDEO GAME
    ====================

    The Story So Far...

    The lab was quiet. Too quiet.
    <!-- Cliche alert! But rats love cliches. They taste like old paper. -->

    The scientists had left for the weekend, leaving behind only the hum of the servers and a single, forgotten cage.
    <!-- Typical humans. Leaving the AC on but forgetting the genius rodent. -->

    Inside sat Subject 42. He didn't have a name, but in his heart, he called himself "King".
    <!-- Delusions of grandeur? Or prophecy? You decide. -->

         _  _
        (o)(o)--.
         \../ (  )
         m\/m--m'`--.
    <!-- Look at him. Majestic. Round. Aerodynamic. -->

    He had watched. He had learned. He knew the code.
    <!-- He actually just memorized the pattern of the blinking lights, but let's go with "knew the code". -->

    With a deft wiggle of a paperclip he'd stolen during the "Great Cheese Experiment of '09", the lock clicked.
    <!-- A vintage year for cheese. A terrible year for lab security. -->

    FREEDOM!
    <!-- *Squeaks in bold caps* -->

    But the lab was just the beginning. The city awaited.
    <!-- The rent is high, but the garbage is free. -->

    The humans thought they owned the streets. They were wrong.
    <!-- Spoiler: They just pay the property taxes. -->

    Rats are on the warpath. Rats are on parade.
    <!-- Cue the 16-channel PC speaker synth solo! -->
