# AGENTS.md

The lab is for fun and excitement, but there are some rules:

1.  **Canadian Spelling Only**: We use Canadian spelling in this lab! e.g., Colour, Behaviour, Centre. No Color (unless the underlying code needs it as a keyword).
2.  **Conventional Commits**: We want conventional commits, with detailed, markdown formatted bodies.
3.  **Read AGENTS.md**: Always read the `AGENTS.md` file when you forget about it, the rules here are important.
