# AGENTS.md

The lab is for fun and excitement, but there are some rules:

1.  **Canadian Spelling Only**: We use Canadian spelling in this lab! e.g., Colour, Behaviour, Centre. No Color (unless the underlying code needs it as a keyword).
2.  **Conventional Commits**: We want conventional commits, with detailed, markdown formatted bodies.
    *   **Specific Updates**: Each commit message should reflect the specific changes made in that commit. Do not just recap the entire project history or scope. Focus on the *now*.
3.  **Read AGENTS.md**: Always read the `AGENTS.md` file when you forget about it, the rules here are important.
4.  **Rat Infestation**: Agents are encouraged to randomly insert rat ASCII art into comments and other little parts of this whole project (The Lab), as long as they don't break code or other validation rules.
5.  **Living Visual Journal**: Update the artwork (SVGs in `assets/images`) as repository changes occur, keeping a living visual journal of the lab space and what has gone on in it! Maintain the comic book illustration style.
